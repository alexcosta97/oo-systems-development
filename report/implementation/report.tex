% Submit a brief Report of the process used to produce the above,
% covering any difficulties encountered alongside the course of
% action taken to overcome them. Also include an appendix recording
% team meetings and discussions.

\section{Process used}
After getting the classes designed, we started implementing the classes in order of the easiest to implement to the hardest being left to last, the main function that linked all the other classes together. We paid special attention to making sure that each class only did what was necessary and that every operation was as simple as possible.

\section{Constraints and Assumptions}
In order to produce the model, we did some assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The payments would always be accepted
  \item An event represents a performance that runs in the theatre for a certain period of time (for example, a musical that is being played at the theatre for two months)
  \item A show is an individual performance of an event (continuing in the musical example, a show would be a single performance of the musical occurring in an evening)
\end{itemize}

\section{Difficulties Encountered}
The major encountered difficulties we had was with identifying how the system would work and how all the classes would be linked to each other, as well as what each one would do (responsibility assignment). In order to overcome it, we decided to modulate the operations as much as possible and get every interested party to do a little bit of work towards its completion.

\section{Contribution and discussions}
The log of contributions and discussions from the team can be found in the appendix at the end of the report.
